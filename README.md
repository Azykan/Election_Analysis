# Election_Analysis
Help Tom and Seth Analyze the election results for the Colorado Board of Elections.

By getting a total vote count of each candidate who received votes.  
Calculating the percentage of each candidate to determine who won the election.

My data resource is the election_results.csv file that I analyzed in Python 3.7 and VS Code 1.65.2 software.

The final analysis of all 3 candidates showed that the winner won with 73.8% of the 369,711 total votes.
